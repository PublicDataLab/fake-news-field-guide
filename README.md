## What is inside

The repository is structured in three main folders:

* **Layout** contains all the InDesign files needed to build the book. They are saved in `InDesign CC 2018`, and are not compatible with previous versions. It also contains all the needed fonts.
* **Texts** contains the texts for the five chapters of the book. They are named `Chapter_X` where X represent the number. `Chapter_0` contains cover page and the introduction, while `chapter_6` contains conclusions, glossaries and acknowledgements. Texts are in `.md` format, a popular markdown format. See below (in ***How to edit texts***) for markdown convention used in the text.
* **Output** contains the latest build of the book in `.pdf` format, and the images for visualizations in `.jpg` format.
